## This project uses react js to create a very simple mini shop. 

Final result here: https://mini-shop-react.netlify.app/

Functionalities:
- displaying of products from an API,
- adding to basket
- removing from basket
- items in the baskets can be seen as list 
- partial purchase flow with form
- data from the form can be sent to a database (with minimal feedback to the user)
- pagination with "load more" button
